# RadioStationOnAChip
I want to create a compact, RF-optimized PCB that includes both the SI4735 and QN8007B ICs. The board should include the following features:
All pins on both the SI4735 (SKYWORKS/SILICON LABS SI4735-D60-GU, SSOP-24-150mil) and QN8007B (QUINTIC QN8007B, QFN24 4x4mm)must be fully broken out and accessible through labeled GPIO headers. Where possible, GPIO pins should be consolidated (such as shared I²C buses or reset lines) without sacrificing flexibility.
The I²S interfaces of both chips must be connected. One I²S output pin from the SI4735 should be routed to a dedicated GPIO header for digital audio output, and one I²S input pin to the QN8007B should be routed from a GPIO header for digital audio input. Level shifting or voltage compatibility should be handled where necessary.
A low-noise amplifier (Analog Devices LTC6268IS8#TRPBF, SO-8) should be added to amplify incoming signals. This includes AM, SW, LW, and SSB signals through a dedicated AM antenna, and FM signals through a shared FM antenna used by both the SI4735 and QN8007B. Both antenna ports on the pcb are U.FL IPEX antenna bases and the traces also connect to gpio pins.
A power amplifier (Analog Devices HMC311LP3ETR, QFN-16(3x3)) should be added to amplify FM transmissions from the QN8007B.
Two Skyworks SPDT RF switches ((Skyworks Solutions SKY13351-378LF, DFN-6-EP(1x1)) should be used. Switch A will select between the FM and AM antennas and send the output to the LNA input. Switch B will route either the LNA output to the SI4735 for receiving, or the QN8007B output through the PA to the FM antenna for transmitting.
The following deliverables are required for this design:
First, a custom KiCad component library must be created. This library should include schematic symbols for the SI4735, QN8007B, SKY13351-378LF, LTC6268, and the HMC311LP3E with correct pin labels and assignments. Default surface-mount footprints should be included for each part.
Second, a complete KiCad netlist must be created, showing all necessary signal, power, control, and RF connections among the components, including the external GPIO headers.
Third, a KiCad PCB generation script using Python (via pcbnew) must be created to automate component placement and initial trace routing. The script should follow a rule set designed to optimize RF layout, including correct orientation, trace lengths, and separation.
Fourth, detailed RF design notes must be provided to ensure best practices are followed during PCB layout. These notes should include guidelines for 50-ohm microstrip transmission line routing, controlled impedance traces, bypass capacitor placement, ground plane management, digital and analog power domain isolation, shielding can usage, and trace separation for transmit and receive paths.
Additional implementation features that must be included are test points on all critical RF, I²S, and control lines; multiple ground vias around all RF components and decoupling capacitors; via stitching around all RF sections; U.FL or IPEX antenna pads for both FM and AM antennas; and optionally, footprints for RF shielding cans over the LNA, PA, and both ICs.
